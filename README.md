Fun fact: the original name for the programming language we now know as Python was "Monty Python." Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, named it after his favorite comedy group, Monty Python's Flying Circus. However, he decided to shorten it to just "Python" to avoid any potential trademark issues. As a tribute, many examples and tutorials in the official documentation of Python use references to Monty Python sketches and characters.
